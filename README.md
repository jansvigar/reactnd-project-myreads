This is Udacity React project by Jan Vigar.
https://myreads-jvigar.herokuapp.com/

## How to install and launch
```
npm install
npm start
```

## Goal

The goal of this project is to correct functionality of the starter template using React. MyReads app should have these functionalities:
1. Move book in or out of the shelves (Currently Reading, Want to Read and Read)
2. Search books using the BooksAPI and display the results

## Added Features

I added a few features on top of the project specification:
1. Display books ratings
2. Allow sorting on Book search results (by title or rating)

## Test

Although this project does not require testing. I added Jest snapshot testing which is really fast and quite useful. Excited to learn more about it.
